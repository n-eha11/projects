# Movie_recommendations readme

This project combines data from two different APIs to make movie recommendations. The TasteDive API lets you provide a movie as a query input, and returns a set of related items. The OMDB API lets you provide a movie title as a query input and get back data about the movie, including scores from various review sites. The resulting lists of related movies are combined and sorted according to their Rotten Tomatoes scores.
